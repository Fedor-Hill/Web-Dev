    <h1>HTML Quotation and Citation Elements</h1>
    <h2>HTML "blockquote" for Quotations</h2>
    <p>The HTML blockquote element defines a section that is quoted from another source. Browsers usually indent
        blockquote elements.</p>

    <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
        For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization,
        WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and
        deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>HTML "q" for Short Quotations</h2>
    <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>

    <h2>HTML "abbr" for Abbreviations</h2>
    <p>The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM". <br>

            Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines. <br>

            Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over
            the element.</p>

    <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>
