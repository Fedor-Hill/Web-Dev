    <h1>HTML id Attribute</h1>
    <p>The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

        You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.</p>

    <h2>The id Attribute</h2>
    <p>The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within
        the HTML document.<br>

        The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by
        JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.<br>

        The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within
        curly braces {}.<br>

        In the following example we have an
        "h1" element that points to the id name "myHeader". This "h1" element will be styled according to the #myHeader
        style definition in the head section</p>

    <h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

    <h2>Difference Between Class and ID</h2>
    <p>A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page</p>
