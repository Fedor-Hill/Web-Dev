    <h1>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h1>
    <p>Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. <br>

        The two most common display values are block and inline.</p>

    <h2>Block-level Elements</h2>
    <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin)
        before and after the element.</p>
    <p>Two commonly used block elements are: "p" and "div".</p>
    <p>The "p" element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.</p>
    <p>A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it
        can).</p>
    <p>The "div" element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.</p>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>An inline element does not start on a new line.</p>
    <p>An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
    <p>This is a "span" element inside a paragraph.</p>
    <span>Hello World</span>

    <h2>The "div" Element</h2>
    <p>The "div" element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.</p>
    <p>The "div" element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.</p>
    <p>When used together with CSS, the "div" element can be used to style blocks of content:</p>

    <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a
            metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The "span" Element</h2>
    <p>The "span" element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.</p>

    <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span
            style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
